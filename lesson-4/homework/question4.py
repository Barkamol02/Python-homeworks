# Number Guessing Game Create a simple number guessing game.

# The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
# If the guess is high, print "Too high!".
# If the guess is low, print "Too low!".
# If they guess correctly, print "You guessed it right!" and exit the loop.
# The player has 10 attempts to guess it. If the player can not find the correct number in 10 attempts, print "You lost. Want to play again? ".
# If the player types one of 'Y', 'YES', 'y', 'yes', 'ok' then start the game from the beginning.
# Hint: Use Pythonâ€™s random.randint() to generate the number.
